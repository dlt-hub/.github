If you’ve been fortunate enough to work for a startup company and a large corporate, you’d know that there are big differences between the two. Visiting a startup, you can’t help but noticing the magic in the air and everyone’s bright-eyed passion, ownership, creative thinking, sense of urgency, and speed of execution. Smaller teams have these in abundance, but as companies turn into corporations, they become slower, and people become comfortably numb.

At ScaleVector we think there needs to be a way to keep people focused on doing big things, while maintaining a startup atmosphere. That’s hard when you’re small, and impossible when you’re too big.

So we set out to support a new type of organization. One that tries to borrow from the good of both worlds — maturity and scale from corporations; agility, creativity and raw passion from startups. We think there's a next evolutionary step in the development of organizations, and it has to be invented and applied.

ScaleVector is currently working on the following set of related problems:

### A GPT-3 Dialogue Generation Tool

We built a few prototypes to gain some understanding of language prediction models such as GPT3. In one of the working prototypes we have learned how GPT-3 can be primed to generate dialogue, which context it needs to perform, some of its limits.
This application is now used in software development for exploratory/end to end testing.

### Data Pipelines For Complex Data

How should ingesting and structuring complex data (such as human language data) in an enterprise environment looke like? 
We have shipped pipelines for AWS and GCP with generic schemas and metrics that enterprises can deploy within days.

Related problems:
- discovery and ingestion of JSON objects into databases
- transforming data into a semantic schema for human usage
- automatically writing a relational data store from a stream of documents

you allow your client to customize pipelines to they can use them
us:90%, 10% them
without customization it is unusable
if they fuck it up, it's them
