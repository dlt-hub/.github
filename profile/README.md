If you’ve been fortunate enough to work for a startup company and a large corporate, you’d know that there are big differences between the two. Visiting a startup, you can’t help but noticing the magic in the air and everyone’s bright-eyed passion, ownership, creative thinking, sense of urgency, and speed of execution. Smaller teams have these in abundance, but as companies turn into corporations, they become slower, and people become comfortably numb.

At ScaleVector we think there needs to be a way to keep people focused on doing big things, while maintaining a startup atmosphere. That’s hard when you’re small, and impossible when you’re too big.

So we set out to support a new type of organization. One that tries to borrow from the good of both worlds — maturity and scale from corporations; agility, creativity and raw passion from startups. We think there's a next evolutionary step in the development of organizations, and it has to be invented and applied.

ScaleVector is currently working on the following set of related problems:

### Language Prediction Models In Enterprise Software Development 

We built a few prototypes to gain some understanding of language prediction models such as GPT3. In one of the working prototypes, a gpt-3 dialogue generation tool, we have learned how GPT-3 can be primed to generate human dialogue, which context it needs to perform well, some of limits of the model.
This application is now used in software development for exploratory/end to end testing.

### Data Pipelines For Complex Data

How should ingesting and structuring complex data (such as human language data) in an enterprise environment looke like? 
We have shipped pipelines for AWS and GCP with generic schemas and metrics that enterprises can deploy within days.

Related problems:
- discovery and ingestion of JSON objects into databases
- transforming data into a semantic schema for human usage
- automatically writing a relational data store from a stream of documents

### Early ROI Of Your Enterprise AI Automation

When they start to deploy next-genaration AI automation enterprises often struggle to understand their ROI. From a business perspective they need this ROI to justify further investment and production roll-out.

At ScaleVector we are able to reverse ETL complex data into Google Analytics. This allows our enterprise clients to use their existing tools and workflows. 
On the client side setup does not require any configuration and developers devs, it can be done by the client's marketing team. We think of Google Analytics as a free solution for complex event analysis, a first step to a data store with further use cases.

### "Keep your notebook, use the enterprise data warehouse"  

Data scientists working on AI problems love to work in notebooks such as Jupyter Notebooks or Google Collab. 
At the same time it is difficult to access enterprise data with these tools and common methods such as Pandas.  

At ScaleVector we allow our clients to access their enterprise data in their notebooks via the Metabase API. 
Related problems:
- complex analysis and visualisation via the Metabase API
- relational data for data scientists
- automatic REST API

managing the semantic schema deployment
you allow your client to customize pipelines to they can use them
us:90%, 10% them
without customization it is unusable
if they fuck it up, it's them
