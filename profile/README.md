Hi ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¥… We are dedicated to solving hard data engineering and AI problems at ScaleVector. This means building novel technology that is used in production and sharing what we learn along the way.

ðŸŽ¡ 
Currently, data source loading frameworks only cater to classic developers or are closed source. At the same time, there are millions of Python developers who want to bring their work into production but need to do ETL.

ðŸš€ We are creating Data Load Tool (DLT), which aims to
- set an open source source standard for building/loading data sources all in pure Python
- grow a community with thousands of sources and snippets shared by users
